# train landetection (segmentation) model

Pipeline to train a simple unet segmentation model to detect lane markings.

use `python3 train.py` to start training. Dataset is not open source yet, but will be released soon.

## Use the trained model
The main purpose of this repo is to give full access to the trained model. You can use `python3 detectlanes.py` to test out the trained pytorch model on your own images or videos. Feel free to copy the code you need to use the model in your own projects.
